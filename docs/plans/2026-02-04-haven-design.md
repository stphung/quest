# Haven: Base Building System - Design Document

## Overview

The Haven is an account-level base building system presented as a skill tree. Players spend prestige ranks and fishing ranks to construct and upgrade rooms that provide permanent passive bonuses. The Haven persists across all prestige resets and benefits every character on the account.

## Unlock Conditions

- **Prestige gate:** Character must be P10+ (Celestial tier)
- **Discovery:** Independent RNG roll per tick (separate from challenge discovery). Chance scales with prestige rank so higher-prestige players find it faster:
  - `chance = 0.000014 + (prestige_rank - 10) * 0.000007`
  - P10: ~2 hours average, P12: ~1 hour, P15: ~34 min, P20: ~20 min
- **One-time:** Once any character discovers the Haven, it remains accessible account-wide to all characters regardless of prestige rank — even if the discovering character drops below P10 through spending

## Currency: Prestige Ranks & Fishing Ranks

Players spend actual prestige ranks and fishing ranks from the contributing character. Ranks decrease when spent. Characters can drop below P10 after discovery without losing Haven access.

Any character who has unlocked the Haven can contribute.

### Tier Costs (per room)

| Tier | Prestige Cost | Fishing Cost |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Basic (T1) | 1 rank | 2 ranks |
| Improved (T2) | 3 ranks | 4 ranks |
| Grand (T3) | 5 ranks | 6 ranks |

**Total to max one room:** 9 prestige, 12 fishing.
**Total to max all 13 rooms:** 117 prestige, 156 fishing.

## Skill Tree Structure

The Haven is a skill tree with a single root (Hearthstone) that branches into two paths: Combat and QoL. Each path forks midway, and both forks must reach T1 before the capstone unlocks.

**Progression rule:** Building a room at T1 unlocks its children. Upgrading to T2/T3 can happen at any time in any order. Capstones require T1 of both parent rooms.

```
                  [Hearthstone]
                 /              \
         Combat Branch        QoL Branch
              |                    |
           Armory              Bedroom
           /    \              /    \
   Training    Trophy     Garden   Library
     Yard       Hall        |        |
       |          |     Fish Dock  Workshop
   Watchtower  Alchemy     \       /
       \       Lab          Vault
        \     /           (capstone)
        War Room
       (capstone)
```

## User Experience

### Discovery

During gameplay, a P10+ character triggers discovery via the existing RNG tick system (~2hr average). The game does **not** pause — ticks continue behind the modal.

A centered modal overlay appears:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                          ║
║           🏠  Haven Discovered           ║
║                                          ║
║   Through the treeline, you glimpse      ║
║   crumbling stone walls wrapped in       ║
║   ivy. A hearthstone chimney still       ║
║   stands, waiting for a fire.            ║
║                                          ║
║   Press [H] anytime to visit.            ║
║                                          ║
║           [Enter] to dismiss             ║
║                                          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Player presses `[Enter]` to dismiss. The Haven is now accessible account-wide via `[H]` from both gameplay and character select. No tutorial — the tree UI is self-explanatory on first visit.

### Character Select Screen

After discovery, the character select screen gains `[H] Haven` in its controls:

```
[Enter] Play  [R] Rename  [D] Delete  [N] New  [Q] Quit
[H] Haven
```

### Haven Skill Tree View

Pressing `[H]` opens the skill tree. Left side shows the tree, right side shows details for the selected room.

Pressing `[Enter]` on a buildable room shows a confirmation overlay:

```

╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Active Bonuses Summary

The Haven screen shows a summary of all active bonuses at the top, visible when you open it via `[H]`:

```
┌──────────────────────── Haven ──────────────────────────┐
│ Active bonuses (5/13 rooms):                             │
│ +10% DMG  +5% XP  +2% Drops  +3% Crit  +15% Regen     │
│ +10% Offline XP                                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         ┌────────────┐  ┌─ ...                           │
```

Bonuses are not shown on the stats panel — the Haven is "set and forget." Players check `[H]` when they want the full picture.

### Vault Item Selection (on Prestige)

When a player prestiges with the Vault built, the prestige confirmation mentions preserved items. After confirming, a selection screen appears:

```
╔═ Vault — Choose 2 Items to Keep ═════╗
║                                        ║
║  Select items to preserve:             ║
║                                        ║
║  > ⚔️ Stormbreaker [Legendary] ★★★★★  ║
║    🛡 Iron Plate [Rare] ★★★           ║
║    🪖 Silk Hood [Uncommon] ★★          ║
║    🧤 Chain Gloves [Common] ★          ║
║    👢 Steel Boots [Rare] ★★★          ║
║    📿 Jade Amulet [Epic] ★★★★         ║
║    💍 Copper Ring [Uncommon] ★★        ║
║                                        ║
║  Selected: 1/2                         ║
║  ⚔️ Stormbreaker                       ║
║                                        ║
║  [Enter] Toggle  [Space] Confirm       ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Number of items equals the Vault tier (T1: 1, T2: 2, T3: 3). Player selects which equipped items to keep. Prestige proceeds with those items preserved.

### Access from Gameplay

During gameplay, `[H]` opens the Haven as an overlay (like the challenge menu). The active character's ranks are shown for spending. `[Esc]` returns to combat. Ticks continue in the background.

## Data Model

### Storage

Account-level file: `~/.quest/haven.json`

Loaded at startup, separate from character saves. All characters read from and write to this shared file.

### Structures

```rust
pub struct Haven {
    pub discovered: bool,
    pub rooms: HashMap<HavenRoomId, u8>,  // room -> tier (0=unbuilt, 1-3)
}

pub enum HavenRoomId {
    Hearthstone,
    // Combat branch
    Armory,
    TrainingYard,
    TrophyHall,
    Watchtower,
    AlchemyLab,
    WarRoom,
    // QoL branch
    Bedroom,
    Garden,
    Library,
    FishingDock,
    Workshop,
    Vault,
}
```

### Bonus Application

Bonuses are computed once when a character is loaded, not every tick. Each system reads the relevant Haven bonus as a base-percentage modifier:

- Combat systems read damage, crit, attack interval, HP regen, drop rate bonuses
- Fishing reads phase timer and rank XP bonuses
- Offline progression reads offline XP bonus
- Challenge discovery reads discovery rate bonus
- Prestige logic reads Vault tier for item preservation

## Integration Points

### Discovery

Separate RNG roll per tick in the game loop, independent from challenge discovery. Requires P10+, not in dungeon/fishing/minigame. Chance scales with prestige: `0.000014 + (prestige_rank - 10) * 0.000007`. On success, set `haven.discovered = true`, save `haven.json`, and show the discovery modal overlay.

### Spending

From the Haven UI, the active character's `prestige_rank` and `fishing.rank` are decremented. Character save is updated immediately after spending.

### Prestige (Vault)

During prestige reset, check Vault tier. Preserve that many equipped items (player chooses which, or highest-scored by auto-equip).

### New Files

```
src/haven.rs              — Data structures, room definitions, tree structure, bonus values
src/haven_logic.rs        — Build/upgrade validation, cost checks, bonus calculation
src/ui/haven_scene.rs     — Skill tree rendering, room detail panel, build confirmation
```

## Player Strategies

- **Rush strategy:** Build every room at T1 (13 prestige, 26 fishing) to unlock all bonuses quickly at low values
- **Deep strategy:** Max out high-value rooms (Training Yard, Armory) before branching further
- **Vault rush:** Push straight down the QoL branch to get Vault T1, then prestige with a preserved weapon
- **Balanced:** Alternate between branches, upgrading as resources allow
